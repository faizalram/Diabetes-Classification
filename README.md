# Diabetes-Classification
This is one of my early personal projects on data science and machine learning. The dataset is obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases accessed via https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-throughout. The objective of this project is to create machine learning model to determine whether a patient has diabetes or not based on the given medical measurement contained in the dataset. For the result, my logistic regression model acquired 83% accuracy through optimization using hyperparameters tuning.
